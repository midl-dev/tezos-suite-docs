# Setup remote signer

Bill of materials:

* one Raspberry Pi 4 with a Geekworm hat
* two batteries
* one LTE dongle
* one USB-to-micro-USB adapter
* one USB-to-USB-C cable

Not included:

* USB power adapter of at least 3A (3,000 mA) supply
* Ethernet cable

## Assembly

Insert the batteries in the Pi Hat. Make sure to respect polarity.

Plug the 4G dongle to a USB 2 port (these are black in color).

Plug the USB-to-micro-USB adapter to a USB 3 port. These are blue in color. **This is important!** The Ledger will be connected to the adapter, and it must be connected to a USB 3 port.

Plug the Ethernet cable to an Internet-connected device.

Plug the USB-to-USB C cable to the USB hat. **Important!** Do not connect the USB-C port to the Raspberry Pi directly, otherwise the battery will not charge.

On the other end, connect the USB cable to the power adapter.

## Visual checks

Check that the battery status LEDs indicate that the device is either charging or fully charged. In steady state, the device should be indicating a full charge. If that is not the case, your adapter may not be powerful enough.

Check that the LED on the 4G LTE dongle shows a solid blue for Huawei (blinking blue for ZTE). If that is not the case, please move your setup to an area of cell phone coverage.

## Connect Ledger

Connect the Baking Ledger Nano S to the Micro-USB end of the adapter. Unlock it and launch the baking app.

## Test alerts

Once the signer is connected to the cloud backend, you may test that the alerting system is working properly.

1. Unplug remote signer power connection.
1. Unplug remote signer wired network connection.
