## Initial baker setup

Prerequisites for secure baking are two Ledger Nano S:

* one that is active all the time, signing baking and endorsing operations
* one used for occasionally transfering funds and voting for protocol amendments, otherwise remaining offline

These Ledgers should be used exclusively for Tezos baking. Do not install other apps, and transfer any other cryptocurrency onto them.

### Setting up Ledgers

Upgrade both Ledgers with the most recent firmware available.

Initialize the first Ledger with a new key. Write down the secret seed as prescribed by the documentation. Do not take a picture of it, keep it offline.

On the first Ledger, install the tezos baker app. Do not install any other app.

Initialize the second Ledger with the secret seed that you wrote down from the first Ledger.

The second Ledger is now a clone of the first. It contains the same keys.

On the second Ledger, install the tezos app. Do not install any other app.

Label Ledgers, ideally with printed labels ("My Tezos Baker Signer" / "My Tezos Baker Offline")

NOTE: you may set up the second Ledger later, as it is not necessary to kick off the baking operations

### Get the Ledger mnemonic

To follow the instructions below, you will need to install the Tezos Command Line Interface. [Follow instructions from Tezos documentation](https://tezos.gitlab.io/introduction/howtoget.html).

The simplest way is to install the Docker containers then run the client in [privileged mode with USB volume mounted](https://tezos.stackexchange.com/questions/395/has-anyone-got-ledger-working-within-docker).

All commands within the container must be prepended with `sudo`.

Note that it is not needed to synchronize the blockchain.

Launch the container in privileged mode with USB bus mounted, and open a terminal in it:

```
docker run --entrypoint /bin/sh --privileged -v /dev/bus/usb:/dev/bus/usb -it --name=my-tezos-client tezos/tezos:latest-release
```

Then issue the command `sudo tezos-client list connected ledgers`.

The Ledger URL including the four-animal-word mnemonic will be displayed, together with commands inviting you to import the key.

There are several cryptographic schemes to choose from. We will be using `ed25519`.

### Choose a derivation path

Ledger has the concept of derivation path - instead of just one address, the device stores multiple addresses. They are related to them by a derivation path, but they are undistinguishable by looking at the public key.

For example, the root path is `/0'/0'`, and the first child path is `/0'/1'`.

It is considered good practice to always use a derived path instead of the root path.

Import the key into your client:

```
sudo tezos-client import secret key ledger_root "ledger://<mnemonic>/ed25519/0'/1'"
```

Then read the public key hash associated with this Leger key and path:

```
sudo tezos-client list known addresses
```

Write down the Ledger URL and the baker's public key hash as they are necessary to spin up the cloud baker.

### Test incoming and outgoing transfers

First, it is recommended to send a small amount of XTZ in the Ledger address, then out again, to verify that the funds are indeed accessible.

Transfer XTZ (from an exchange or any other source) to the address discovered above.

Then, with CLI, do an outbound transfer to an outbound address that you control (such as an address for incoming transfer on an exchange). For example, to transfer 1 XTZ, issue the following command:

```
sudo tezos-client --endpoint https://mainnet-tezos.giganode.io transfer 1 from ledger_root to <outbound address>
```

Since this is an on-chain operation, we pass the parameters `--endpoint https://mainnet-tezos.giganode.io` to connect to a [publicly accessible Tezos node](https://tezos.giganode.io/). If you have a fully synced node running locally, you can omit these parameters.

The Ledger should prompt you to confirm. Pay close attention to what is displayed on the Ledger screen, verify that it does what you want it to do.

### Transfer funds

After verifying that you are able to transfer in and out of your baking address, transfer enough funds (at least one roll of XTZ) to start baking.

### Setup Ledger to bake

On the Ledger used for baking, launch the baking app and connect it to your computer after disconnecting the other Ledger used for transfers.

Then issue the following:

```
sudo tezos-signer setup ledger to bake for <ledger_url> --main-chain-id NetXdQprcVkpaWU
```

The Ledger should prompt you to confirm. It will display the baker address and the chain ID. Verify that it corresponds to your baker address.

Note: `NetXdQprcVkpaWU` is the chain id for Tezos mainnet. For a testnet deployment, change it to the relevant chain-id.

### Register as delegate

To start baking, you must sign an on-chain operation indicating the network that you register to get baking and endorsing slots.

When you register, there is a grace period of two full cycles. Then, you get assigned baking and endorsing slots for five cycles in the future. It means that there is approximately a 21 day gap between the moment you register as delegate and your first on-chain validation operation. Hence it is required to perform this operation well in advance of the planned launch date of the baker.


With the Ledger used for baking still connected, issue the following operation:

```
sudo tezos-client --endpoint https://mainnet-tezos.giganode.io register key <baking address> as delegate
```

Again, this is an on-chain operation, so you either need to connect to a public node (like above) or have a fully synced node running locally.

The Ledger should prompt you to confirm. Pay close attention to what is displayed on the Ledger screen, verify that it does what you want it to do.

Verify on an explorer such as tzstats that your address is indeed registered as a baker.
